# Project in progress................................................

The project is therefore to develop your professional blog. This website is divided into two main groups of pages:

pages useful to all visitors;
the administration pages of your blog.
Here is the list of pages that should be accessible from your website:

the home page ;
the page listing all the blog posts;
the page displaying a blog post;
the page for adding a blog post;
the edit page of a blog post;
the pages for modifying / deleting a blog post;
user login / registration pages.
You will develop an administration part which should only be accessible to registered and validated users.

The administration pages will therefore be accessible under certain conditions and you will ensure the security of the administration part.

Let's start with the pages that are useful to all Internet users.

On the home page, you should present the following information:

your first and last name;
a photo and / or a logo;
a slogan that suits you (example: “Martin Durand, the developer you need!”);
a menu allowing you to navigate among all the pages of your website;
a contact form (when submitting this form, an email with all this information will be sent to you) with the following fields:
last name First Name,
Contact email,
a message,
a link to your CV in PDF format;
and all the links to social networks where you can be followed (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter ...).
On the page listing all blog posts (newest to oldest), you should display the following information for each blog post:

the title ;
the date of the last modification;
the châpo;
and a link to the blog.
On the blog post details page, the following information should be displayed:

the title ;
the chapô;
contents ;
the author;
the date of the last update;
the form for adding a comment (submitted for validation);
lists of validated and published comments.
On the edit page of a blog article, the user can edit the title, chapô, author and content fields.

In the footer menu, there must be a link to access the blog administration
